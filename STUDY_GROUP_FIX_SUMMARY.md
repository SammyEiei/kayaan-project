# Study Group Creation Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The study group creation feature was not saving data to the backend database because:
1. The group store was using mock data instead of real API calls
2. GroupService was not imported or used in the group store
3. No proper error handling or user feedback was implemented
4. Environment variables for backend connection were not properly configured

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Group Store (`src/stores/group.ts`)
- **Added GroupService import**: Now imports and uses the actual GroupService instead of mock data
- **Updated createGroup function**: Replaced mock creation with real API call to `GroupService.createGroup()`
- **Updated fetchGroups function**: Replaced mock data with real API call to `GroupService.getMyGroups()`
- **Added auth store integration**: Now uses `useAuthStore()` to get current user ID for ownership

### 2. Enhanced CreateGroupForm Component (`src/components/CreateGroupForm.vue`)
- **Added loading state**: Shows loading spinner and disables form during submission
- **Added error handling**: Displays error messages when group creation fails
- **Added success feedback**: Shows success message when group is created successfully
- **Improved UX**: Form fields are disabled during submission, button text changes

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- **Added environment variable support**: Now properly loads and uses environment variables
- **Added fallback URL**: Defaults to `http://localhost:8080/api` if no environment variable is set
- **Enhanced configuration**: Uses `loadEnv` to load environment variables dynamically

### 4. Created Environment Setup Documentation (`ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`)
- **Comprehensive setup guide**: Explains how to configure backend connection
- **Multiple configuration options**: Provides different ways to set environment variables
- **Troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and solutions
- **Verification steps**: How to confirm the setup is working

## Key Changes Made

### Before (Mock Implementation)
```typescript
// Mock creation - no backend connection
const newGroup: StudyGroup = {
  id: Date.now().toString(),
  name: groupData.name,
  description: groupData.description,
  ownerId: 'current-user',
  // ... other mock data
}
```

### After (Real API Implementation)
```typescript
// Real API call with backend connection
const response = await GroupService.createGroup(groupData)
const newGroup: StudyGroup = {
  id: response.id,
  name: response.name,
  description: response.description,
  ownerId: authStore.currentUserId?.toString() || 'unknown',
  // ... transformed from API response
}
```

## Environment Configuration Required

To make this work, you need to set the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable:

### Option 1: Create `.env` file
```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

### Option 2: Use `.env.local` file
```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

### Option 3: Set in system environment
```bash
export VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

## API Endpoints Expected

The backend should have these endpoints:
- `POST /api/groups` - Create a new study group
- `GET /api/groups/my` - Get current user's groups

## Testing Steps

1. **Set environment variable** with your backend URL
2. **Restart development server** to load new environment variables
3. **Open browser console** to see API request logs
4. **Try creating a study group** using the form
5. **Check Network tab** in DevTools for API calls
6. **Verify in backend database** that the group was created

## Expected Console Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
ðŸš€ API Request: POST /api/groups
ðŸ”§ Full URL: http://localhost:8080/api/api/groups
âœ… Authorization header added (valid JWT)
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to create group" error
- Check if backend is running and accessible
- Verify the API endpoint exists
- Check CORS configuration on backend
- Ensure authentication token is valid

### Issue: API calls going to wrong URL
- Verify `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable
- Restart development server after changes
- Check vite.config.ts fallback URL

### Issue: CORS errors
- Backend needs CORS configured for frontend domain
- Check if backend is running on expected port

## Next Steps

1. **Configure backend URL** in environment variables
2. **Test group creation** with real backend
3. **Verify data persistence** in database
4. **Test group listing** functionality
5. **Implement additional features** like group editing, deletion
